I love cribbage, so I thought I'd try making my own game.

I started with the crib_counter, which aggregates the points a person gets when they count their crib (or regular hand).

The game is currently only playable by two humans (which is not even really playable since on the terminal you know all of the other cards used by the other player).

Still, it was good practice and I think there are a lot of places where I can build in extra functionality and neaten up the code (aka a lot more practice to get from the game).
