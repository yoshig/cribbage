I love cribbage, so I thought I'd try making my own game.

I started with the crib_counter, which aggregates the points a person gets when they count their crib (or regular hand).

I'm currently working on the actual framework of the game, but I think there is a ton of work to be done. Especially on some of the aspects like counting the Play and The Go phase.
